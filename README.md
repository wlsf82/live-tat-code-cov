# Live TAT Code Coverage

Sample project created using create-react-app to demonstrate how to extract code coverage report while running end-to-end tests with Cypress.

## Installation

Run `yarn` to install the project and dev dependencies.

## Starting the app

Run `yarn start` to start the app in development mode.

## Tests

Run `yarn e2e` to run the tests in headless mode.

> **Note:** This command already automatically starts the app, runs the tests, and shuts the app down.

> **Note 2:** Alternatively, you can run `yarn start` in one terminal, and `yarn cy:open` in another, to run the tests in interactive mode.

## Code coverage

Run `yarn coverage` to generate and open the HTML code coverage report.
